# Technical Solution

Please check the code comments in the following files for detailed modifications:

- `user-form.component.ts`：Main business logic implementation
- `user-form.component.html`：Form UI implementation
- `user-service.service.ts`：Data service layer implementation

## Features

- Form validation and error handling optimization
- Name auto-update: `full_name` updates automatically with changes to `first_name` and `last_name`
- Skills management: Supports skill search, autocomplete, add/remove functionality
- New feature: Name pronunciation button (for international communication)
- Toast notifications: Provides user feedback for form actions and errors

## Known Issue

Since `api.service.ts` is marked as "DO NOT MODIFY", skills data is not persisted after page refresh. Backend support would be needed for complete implementation of this feature.
